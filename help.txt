1: Eliminate obvious cases, and see if you can simplify the problem.
- simple cases and make observations like "this cant work"

2: Ignore unnecessary information, and use it to draw the problem in new ways.
- eg. : min(n, k) when k is too large and n is manageable

3: Making obvious lower and upper bounds, and proving they are constructible.
- answer must at least be this or can at most be this

4: Finding invariants.
- by the invariant, this holds

5: Define something that cannot change much.
- make an invariant
